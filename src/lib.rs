//! # Raxiom
//! Raxiom is an (experimental) astrophysical simulation library
//! using the rust game engine [`bevy`](https://docs.rs/bevy/*/bevy).
//!
//! At this point, Raxiom supports a Barnes-Hut tree gravity solver as
//! well as smoothed particle hydrodynamics. In order to allow highly
//! parallel simulations, Raxiom uses MPI communication between
//! multiple Bevy apps. Moreover, each Bevy app is parallelized
//! internally using Bevys inherent parallelism and parallel queries.
//! This reduces the amount of MPI ranks needed and might even allow
//! automatic "zero-effort" latency hiding by running non-conflicting
//! systems in parallel - systems which are currently blocked by
//! communication latency or delay do not block program execution.
//!
//! In order to properly understand the multi-physical nature of
//! astrophysics, simulations require accurate treatment of many
//! different phenomena, such as gravity, hydrodynamics, chemistry,
//! the formation of stars and black holes, radiation transport and
//! many more.  Raxiom enables building such simulations in the "Bevy
//! way", treating these phenomena as modular plugins which can be
//! added and configured individually.  The reason Raxiom exposes a
//! library structure instead of consisting of a single, all-powerful,
//! configurable binary is that this allows the user to easily add
//! additional behavior to the simulation without requiring an ever
//! increasing set of configuration flags and parameters for the
//! binary. Injecting such custom behavior into the "main loop"
//! of the code is made easy by the structure of ECS in general and
//! Bevys amazing modularity in particular.
//!
//! Here is how this might look in practice:
//!
//! ## A basic example
//! ```no_run
//! use raxiom::prelude::*;
//! use raxiom::components::*;
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut sim = SimulationBuilder::new();
//!     sim.parameters_from_relative_path(file!(), "parameters.yml")
//!         .update_from_command_line_options()
//!         .build()
//!         .add_plugin(GravityPlugin)
//!         .add_plugin(HydrodynamicsPlugin)
//!         .add_system(my_custom_behavior)
//!         .run();
//! }
//!
//! fn my_custom_behavior(
//!     mut commands: Commands,
//!     mut particles: Particles<(Entity, &Position, &Mass)>,
//! ) {
//!     for (entity, position, mass) in particles.iter() {
//!         if **mass > units::Mass::kilograms(9000.0) {
//!             // The mass is too high, we should refine this into two particles
//!             commands.entity(entity).despawn();
//!             commands.spawn_bundle((position.clone(), Mass(**mass / 2.0)));
//!             commands.spawn_bundle((position.clone(), Mass(**mass / 2.0)));
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
